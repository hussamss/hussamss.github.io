    <h3>Implementation and performance analysis of 3D cone and frustum filters</h3>
    <h4 class="text-right">Publisher: University of Victoria</h4>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Background: In this thesis, new effective and efficient implementation structures of three-dimensional (3D) spatio-temporal (ST) Finite Impulse Response (FIR) uniform and non-uniform cone and frustum filters using well-known filter banks are investigated. The performance of the proposed implementation structures for 3D ST FIR uniform and non-uniform cone and frustum filters are investigated for 3D broadband beamforming in radio astronomy applications. 
 
    <p>First, implementations of two 3D ST uniform FIR cone filters are investigated. The 3D cone filters are designed by cascading either the well-known uniform quadrature mirror â€“ cosine-modulated (QM-CM) filter bank or directly designed filter banks (DDFBs), with 2D low-pass circularly-symmetric spatial filters. In addition, two 3D ST uniform FIR frustum filters are derived from the cone filters by implementing partial bands of the filter banks with corresponding 2D spatial filters. The performance of the proposed implementation structures for 3D ST uniform QM-CM and DDFBs cone and frustum filters are evaluated using broadband beamforming signals in radio astronomy applications. The performance of the QM-CM and DDFBs cone and frustum filters shows improvement in terms of Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise ratio (SINRs) over existing 3D ST cone and frustum filters. In addition to their effective performance, these cone and frustum filters can be efficiently implemented with equivalent or less computational complexity compared to existing methods.</p>
 
    <p>Second, implementations of two 3D ST non-uniform cone and frustum filters are explored. These cone and frustum filters are obtained by cascading either QM-CM or DDFBs non-uniform filter banks, with 2D low-pass circularly-symmetric spatial filters. The motivation for the 3D ST non-uniform cone and frustum filters is to achieve better approximation at low temporal frequencies than using the uniform ones. The performance of the 3D ST non-uniform cone and frustum filters is evaluated and compared with the performance of the uniform 3D ST cone and frustum filters. Results indicate that the performance of the proposed 3D ST non-uniform QM-CM and DDFBs cone filters shows some improvement in selective filtering compared to the performance of 3D ST uniform cone filters.</p>

    <p>Abstract:
      Two novel computationally efficient implementations for 3-D FIR cone filters are proposed in this paper. In the proposed implementations, the well-known 1-D quadrature mirror cosine modulated and 1-D directly designed temporal filter banks are cascaded with 2-D FIR circularly symmetric lowpass spatial filters to approximate the cone-shaped passband. Furthermore, the 3-D FIR frustum filters are derived from the proposed 3-D FIR cone filter implementations. The proposed implementations provide additional 2 dB signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio improvement compared to previously reported 3-D FIR cone and frustum filter implementations with reduced or equivalent computational complexity.</p>
