      <div class="panel-body panel-success"><p>Digital Signal Processing is distinguished from other areas in computer science by the unique type of data it uses: signals. In most cases, these signals originate as sensory data from the real world: seismic vibrations, visual images, sound waves, etc. DSP is the mathematics, the algorithms, and the techniques used to manipulate these signals after they have been converted into a digital form. This includes a wide variety of goals, such as: enhancement of visual images, recognition and generation of speech, compression of data for storage and transmission, etc. Suppose we attach an analog-to-digital converter to a computer and use it to acquire a chunk of real world data.</p>
      <p>The roots of DSP are in the 1960s and 1970s when digital computers first became available. Computers were expensive during this era, and DSP was limited to only a few critical applications. Pioneering efforts were made in four key areas: radar & sonar, where national security was at risk; oil exploration, where large amounts of money could be made; space exploration, where the data are irreplaceable; and medical imaging, where lives could be saved. The personal computer revolution of the 1980s and 1990s caused DSP to exploded with new applications. Rather than being motivated by military and government needs, DSP was suddenly driven by the commercial marketplace. Anyone who thought they could make money in the rapidly expanding field was suddenly a DSP vender. DSP reached the public in such products as: mobile telephones, compact disc players, and electronic voice mail.</p>
      <p>During my master study in University of Victoria, I focus my study and research in Digital Signal Processing and the Development of Signal Processing Applications using programming languages and simulation tools. Therefore, I studied several core courses in digital signal processing and programming languages which includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Continuous-Time Signals and Systems</li>
        <li>Digital Signal Processing I</li>
        <li>Control Theory and Systems II</li>
        <li>Engineering Design by Optimization</li>
        <li>Digital Image/Video Processing</li>
        <li>Applications of Digital Signal Processing Techniques</li>
        <li>Selected Topics in Digital Signal Processing (Machine Learning)</li>
        <li>Directed Study (Design of Digital Filters)</li>
        <li>Programming languages C, C++, Python, Matlab</li>
      </ul></div>

      <p>Instrumentation is defined as the art and science of measurement and control of process variables within a production or manufacturing area. The process variables used in industries are Level, Pressure, Temperature, Humidity, Flow, pH, Force, Speed etc. Control engineering or control systems engineering is the engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. Control engineers are responsible for the research, design, development and control devices/systems, typically in manufacturing facilities and plants. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed). Multi-disciplinary in nature, control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range.</p>
      <p>During my study in Jubail Industrail College, I built my foundation and background in electrical and control engineering. The following list includes the basics and advanced courses:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Instrumentation and Measurements </li>
        <li>Electrical and Electronic Circuits</li>
        <li>Analogue and Digital Electronics</li>
        <li>Electrical Machines and Process Equipment</li>
        <li>Instrumentation Engineering</li>
        <li>Digital System Design</li>
        <li>Process Instrumentation</li>
        <li>Control Engineering</li>
        <li>Advanced Microprocessors and Microcontrollers</li>
